# A study of quote similarity among politicians

## Introduction
In this project we investigate similarity among American politicians in different aspects. First, we perform a time correlation study to find politicians that tend to be quoted at the same time. This could for example suggest that these politicians focus on the same subject. Second, we expand the study by also comparing the actual content of the quotes made by the politicians, and compare the politicians by their quotes that they've made. Here we find interesting clusters of politicians that make similar quotes. Lastly, we study how both the time correlation and quote similarity have varied over the last three years in the QuoteBank dataset for an interesting pair of politicians, namely the former Secretary of State John Kerry and the current President Joe Biden.

## QuoteBank
Before we begin, let's gain some more insight into the data we use for the project.
In 2019, 3005 US policians were quoted. In total these were quoted 1'306'702 nr of times.
**Let's see the distribution of gender and party among the politicians in the dataset**
